<h3><u>Data Structure </u></h3>

#### 🔍What actually  is data structure ?
**->**   ***Data structure is  the effective organization of data***

<h3><u>Algorithm</u></h3>

#### 🔍What is Algorithm ?
**->**  ***Algorithm is the step by step solution of a problem***

#### ✨ Characters of good algorithms: 

- **Correctness** :    *The solution provided by the algorithm must be correct.* 
- **Effectiveness** : *Algorithm must provide a effective solution to a problem.*
- **Finiteness** : *The solution must be limited to finite steps.*
- **Existence of a solution**  : *The solution for the algorithm must exist.*

#### 🔍Why the data structure and algorithms are so important ?
**->**  *Data structure and algorithm are building block for any problems as algorithm deals with the solution of the problem where as data structure the organization of data , by the combination of both we can solve the problems more efficiently*

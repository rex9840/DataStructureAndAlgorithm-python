<h3><u>Data Structure </u></h3>

#### 🔍What actually  is data structure ?
**->**   ***Data structure is  the effective organization of data***

#### 📌Types of data structures:
- **Primitive**
    - Integer
    - Float 
    - Character 
    - String 
    - Boolean 


- **Non-Primitive(User-defined)**
-    - ***Linear*** 
        - Static
            - array 
        - Dynamic
            - linked list
            - stack 
            - queue 
   
-    - ***Non linear***
        - Tree
        - Graph

<h3><u>Algorithm</u></h3>

#### 🔍What is Algorithm ?
**->**  ***Algorithm is the step by step solution of a problem***

#### ✨ Characters of good algorithms: 

- **Correctness** :    *The solution provided by the algorithm must be correct.* 
- **Effectiveness** : *Algorithm must provide a effective solution to a problem.*
- **Finiteness** : *The solution must be limited to finite steps.*
- **Existence of a solution**  : *The solution for the algorithm must exist.*

#### 📌  Types of algorithm 
- **Simple recursive algorithm**
    **->** *use of recursion* 
-  **Divide and conquer algorithm**
    **->** *divide the problems into smaller chunks and solve them recursively*  
    **->**  *combine the smaller chunks into the solution* 
- **Dynamic programming algorithm**
    **->** *based on memorization  they use past results to find new solution for the given problem* 
- **Greedy algorithm**
    **->**  *we hope to choose local optimization in each step so we will end up with global optimization*
 
- **Brute force algorithm**
    **->**  *tries every solution until satisfactory result is found*

- **Randomize algorithm**
    **->**  *uses random number during compilation to make a decision

#### 🔍Why the data structure and algorithms are so important ?
**->**  *Data structure and algorithm are building block for any problems as algorithm deals with the solution of the problem where as data structure the organization of data , by the combination of both we can solve the problems more efficiently*
